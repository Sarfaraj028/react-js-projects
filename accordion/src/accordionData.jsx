        question: "What is React",
        answer: "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, manage state, and efficiently update the view by using a Virtual DOM to minimize direct DOM manipulation, enhancing performance."
    },
    {
        question: "Why we use React",
        answer: "We use React.js because it provides a fast, efficient, and flexible way to build user interfaces. It simplifies the development of interactive web applications by using components, allowing for reusable code, efficient updates with its virtual DOM, and easy state management. React also enables the creation of dynamic and responsive UIs with minimal performance overhead, making it ideal for building modern, scalable web applications."
    },
    {
        question: "Components in React",
        answer: "In React, components are reusable, self-contained building blocks that define how a user interface (UI) should appear and behave. Each component can manage its own state and render UI elements. Components can be either functional or class-based, and they can be nested, updated, and reused throughout an application to create dynamic and modular UIs."
    }
    ,{
        question: "Hooks in React",
        answer: "In React, hooks are functions that allow you to use state, lifecycle features, and other React features in functional components. Hooks were introduced to simplify the use of state and side effects in components without needing to use class components."
